# Public-Library-Database-Design

This project is to design a `database system` for `public library`. 
For the users, they are able to `search`, `borrow`, and `return` books. They also can `check` their own information.
For the librarians, they can perform `book information management`, `member information management`, and `book borrow & return management`.

## Steps:

1. Analyzed the data requirements for the system.

2. Drew the initial `ER diagram` for the system. Indicated cardinality and participation constraints on ER diagram. 

3. Mapped the ER diagram into `relational schema`. Showed the resulting relational schema

4. Discuss `database normalization` rules on the tables. Showed the functional dependencies that violate `1st`, `2nd` and `3rd` `normal forms`. Normalize the tables into 3NF.

5. Showed the final relational schema after normalization.

6. Created tables using appropriate `SQL` command. 

7. PL/SQL: Define two different stored `procedures` and two `triggers`.

8. Implement `CRUD` operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) for the tables by using `PHP`. We used `MAMP` application package for implementation.
