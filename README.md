# Public-Library-Database-Design
This project is to design a dabase system for public library. 
For the users, they are able to search, borrow, and return books. They also can check their own information.
For the librarians, they can perform book information, member information, and book borrow & return management.

Step 1: Analyzed the data requirements for the system.
Step 2: Drew the initial ER diagram for the system. Indicated cardinality and participation constraints on ER diagram. 
Step 3: Mapped the ER diagram into relational schema. Showed the resulting relational schema
Step 4: Discuss database normalization rules on the tables. Showed the functional dependencies that violate 1st, 2nd and 3rd normal forms. Normalize the tables into 3NF.
Step 5: Showed the final relational schema after normalization.
Step 6: Created tables using appropriate SQL command. 
Step 7: PL/SQL: Define two different stored procedures and two triggers.
Step 8: Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) for the tables by using PHP. We used MAMP application package for implementation.
